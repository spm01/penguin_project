# penguin_project

This is a project using the _penguins_ package in R to classify types of penguins based on existing traits including island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex to predict species. 
For missing data, I use imputation via nearest neighbors and the MICE package. 

My method of prediction uses decision trees, first by hand, then using pre-exisitng packages. 

My final results are summarized in tables of decision trees that split penguin groups into 25 Adelie, 16 Chinstrap, and 25 Gentoo penguins.

As always, the PDF file has cleanest formatting.
